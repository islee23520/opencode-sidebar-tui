## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Support multi-file selection in Explorer context menu - multiple files are now sent together as `@file1 @file2 @file3`
- Improve drag-and-drop handling for VS Code editor tabs - files dragged from editor tabs are now properly captured
- Remove duplicate "Send to OpenCode Terminal" from editor context menu - only "Send File Reference (@file)" remains
- Fix multi-file drag-and-drop from Explorer - all selected files are now processed instead of just the first one

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-06

### Added

- **HTTP API Integration**: Bidirectional communication with OpenCode CLI via HTTP API
  - Auto-discovery of OpenCode CLI HTTP server on ephemeral ports (16384-65535)
  - Health check endpoint (`/health`) for availability validation
  - Prompt append endpoint (`/tui/append-prompt`) for sending commands
  - Exponential backoff retry logic for reliable communication
  - Configurable timeout (default: 5000ms)

- **Auto-Context Sharing**: Automatically shares editor context when terminal opens
  - Shares all open files on terminal startup
  - Includes line numbers for active selections
  - Format: `@path/to/file#L10-L20`
  - Configurable via `opencodeTui.autoShareContext` setting

- **Port Management Service**: Ephemeral port allocation for HTTP communication
  - Port range: 16384-65535 (standard ephemeral range)
  - Collision detection and prevention
  - Per-terminal port tracking
  - Automatic cleanup on terminal closure

- **Context Sharing Service**: Editor context detection and formatting
  - Detects current file and selection
  - Formats file references with line numbers
  - Supports `@file`, `@file#L10`, `@file#L10-L20` formats

- **New Configuration Options**:
  - `opencodeTui.enableHttpApi`: Enable/disable HTTP API (default: `true`)
  - `opencodeTui.httpTimeout`: HTTP request timeout in milliseconds (default: `5000`, range: 1000-30000)
  - `opencodeTui.autoShareContext`: Auto-share editor context on terminal open (default: `true`)

### Changed

- **Architecture Documentation**: Clarified sidebar-only architecture
  - Added explicit note that this is a sidebar-only extension (not native VS Code: terminal)
  - Documented HTTP API vs WebView messaging architecture
  - Updated feature list to highlight HTTP API capabilities

- **Communication Method**: Migrated from terminal I/O to HTTP API for reliable bidirectional communication
  - More reliable than terminal stdin/stdout parsing
  - Better error handling and retry capabilities
  - Cleaner separation of concerns

### Technical

- Added `OpenCodeApiClient` for HTTP communication with retry logic
- Added `PortManager` for ephemeral port allocation
- Added `ContextSharingService` for editor context detection
- Added `TerminalDiscoveryService` for terminal integration
- Added `OutputCaptureManager` for output handling
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new services
